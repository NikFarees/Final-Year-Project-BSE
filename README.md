# KMSE Driving School Management System 🚗

A Final Year Project developed for Konsortium Memandu Sejati Erat (KMSE), a driving school based in Pasir Mas, Kelantan. This web-based system streamlines lesson bookings, test scheduling, and payment tracking for students and instructors, improving efficiency and reducing reliance on manual processes.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**KMSE Driving School Management System** was built to modernize the current semi-manual operations of the driving school. The existing workflow depends on a hybrid of digital (MyDIIMS) and manual logbook systems, which has created inefficiencies and scalability issues.

### 🎯 This system aims to:
- Develop an online Driving School Management System for Konsortium Memandu Sejati Erat.
- Enable students to book lessons online.
- Provide instructors with efficient scheduling tools.
- Offer administrators a centralized platform to manage bookings, payments, and student information.
- Streamline operations and enhance the overall user experience.

### 📚 Background
KMSE provides driving courses for various license types including:

- Manual Cars (D)
- Auto Cars (DA)

While MyDIIMS helps with registration, payment, and permit tracking, lesson bookings and test scheduling are still done manually using logbooks. This requires students to visit the school in person and introduces risks like human error, time inefficiency, and scheduling conflicts.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

- Inconvenient and Manual Booking Process for Students

## 🚀 Objective

- To create an online system for students to book lessons, so they don’t need to visit in person.
